Last decade marked by the second coming of virtualization. The birth
of cloud put a great demand on systems to be portable and replaceable. Now
networks follow the computing nodes and become virtualizable. That is how the
SDN was born. As it moves forward more and more originally hardware functions
move to the portable and flexible software domain.

On the other side, formal verification techniques have grown strong enough to
certify complete and practical systems. Such systems as a compiler, an operating
system kernel, a distributed key value store or a file system.

However, the software development methods do not keep up with the raising
responsibility. It is traditionally difficult to develop a reliable software
implementation of an originally hardware component.

We take advantage of network domain-specific features and formal methods
achievements to guarantee the reliability of such components.
