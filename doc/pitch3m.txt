The low level high speed network functions are called dataplane. Coming from
hardware cercuits historically they feature some design rules that help
verification. The code is usually small and control path length is limited. It
is modular with a well defined interface - a frame or a packet.

<slide2>

On this slide you see a typical dataplane architecture with different
stateful and stateless modules.

We follow a previous work that succeded in applying symbolic execution method to
stateless dataplane modules.

<slide2a>

Such modules as a packet classifier, a checker, an ethernet encapsulation and
decapsulation. However, due to symbolic execution limitations it can not deal
with a mutable state.

<slide2b>

And it is difficult to find a practical application that would not have it.

<slide3>

In order to handle stateful modules, we plan to encapsulate the state into a set
of common data structures. We then implement and certify them with a different
approach. Finally, we extend the symbolic engine with theories encorparating
specifications of that data structures.
