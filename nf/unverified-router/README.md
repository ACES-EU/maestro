##Files:

router.c and parse_utils.c contains the code for the router. tests.c is an old test file used to test the parsing and the lpm that used the trie (made by Xavier Moser).

##Progress

For the moment, the router_config.c  doesn't do anything => the router doesn't take any command line arguments
